        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bread</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Herbs</li>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                MPrep your pan & bread. Line a large baking sheet with parchment
                paper or tinfoil, slice your bread in half lengthwise, and place
                the bread cut side up on the baking sheet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make the garlic butter. In a small bowl mix the herbs and salt
                together with the softened butter. Spread it evenly over the top
                of the bread halves.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake & serve. Bake the bread for 10-15 minutes at 425 degrees F
                until it’s slightly golden brown on the edges. If you’re adding
                cheese, add it in the last 2 minutes of baking. Then cool, slice
                into 1-inch pieces, and devour!
