        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Pizza is an Italian dish typically consisting of a flat base of
            leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomato, cheese, and other
            ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a
            wood-fired oven.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bread Flour</li>
            <li>Instant Yeast</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Passata</li>
            <li>Fresh Basil</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Mozzarella</li>
            <li>Cherry Tomatoes</li>
            <li>Basil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the
                yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the
                olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have
                a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface
                and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and
                set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s
                not essential for a thin crust.

                Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a
                quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface,
                roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a
                rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in
                the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.
            </li>
            <li>
                Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another
                baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top
                shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter
                with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put
                one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated
                sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a
                little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step
                for remaining pizza.
